Hi, I am 223230. I'm an experimental musician, CS student, and I develop VST/CLAP plug-ins and websites. 99% of my repos are private, I may make some of them public once they are in a presentable state.

I'm working on [![logo_mini](https://github.com/223230/223230/assets/68156346/4f1ea849-b43b-4707-b692-c3d411eaa9f3) Cyma](https://github.com/223230/cyma), a Rust library of controls and visualizers for VST/CLAP plugin UIs.
