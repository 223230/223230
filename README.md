I'm a 19-year old interdisciplinary in my final year of high school. When it comes to coding, my strong suit is Javascript, but I'm constantly trying to learn new things. As of right now, I'm learning digital signal processing in Rust.

Aside from programming, I'm well-versed in sound design, digital music production, graphic design, and general computer hackery. As of right now, I can't and don't want to be engaged in any projects, but once I am through with my finals, that may change :)

## Tech I use

Mainly, I use:
  * Various JavaScript frameworks, such as **React**, **Vue**, and **TailwindCSS**
  * **Rust**, although I'm still quite new
  * Back-end tools such as **Nginx** and **MySQL**
  * Various software, editors and design / music production tools
